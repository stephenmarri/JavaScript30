                Why Go To Amsterdam
            </h2>

Don't believe everything you hear about Amsterdam. Yes, this Netherlands city takes a lax look at women beckoning business in the Red Light District and "coffee shops" selling an unorthodox type of herb to a toking clientele, but these descriptions only scratch the surface. At some point, during an excellent Indonesian meal,

a twilight canal-side rambling or a shopping excursion through the boutiques of Nine Little Streets, you'll realize – as many travelers have before you – that there's much more to Amsterdam than you might've thought.

And although the city's loose laws on vice seem to attract a college-age, male-dominant crowd, Amsterdam is also ideal as a romantic getaway for two or an educational excursion with the kids. With attractions that range from biking along a maze of canals to remembering the Holocaust through the eyes of Anne Frank; from exploring the swirling Expressionism of Vincent van Gogh to lazing in the expansive Vondelpark, Amsterdam suits a variety of traveler tastes.

Soul food, French or international cuisine? Amsterdam boasts several Michelin star restaurants as well as many great
bistros and terraces. Go for a tour on the Pannenkoekenboot (Pancake Boat), enjoy a vegan snack, or grab a quintessentially Dutch frikandel 'from the wall' at Febo. Where to eat in Amsterdam? This city has it all!

Exploring Amsterdam by boat and bicycle
The name of the city dates from the 12th century, when a dam was built in the Amstel river. Today the water is still a defining element of Amsterdam. You should definitely go on a boat tour of Amsterdam and discover the historic canal ring, which became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2011.
