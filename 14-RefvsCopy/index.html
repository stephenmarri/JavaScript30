    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let name = "steve"
    let name2 = name
    console.log(name, name2);
    name = "mar"
    console.log(name, name2);
    name2 = "wes"
    console.log(name, name2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    console.clear();
    let players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    let p2 = players
    //console.log(players, p2);
    //p2[3] = "new name"
    //console.log(players, p2);
    //let p3 = [...players]
    let p3 = Array.from(players)
    p3[3] = "Max"
    console.log(players,p3);

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };
    let per = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(person))
    per.name = "New Name"
    console.log(person, per);

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
